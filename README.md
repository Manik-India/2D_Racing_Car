# Project: 2D Racing Car

### Introduction to the Project?
The main aim of our game is to increase the concentration of the player as the speed of the car increases with levels along with overcoming the obstacles that come in it’s path. The player’s goal is to make the highest possible score to avoid bumping into the obstacles.

This project demonstrates the creation of a moving racing car along with a race track and scenery. OpenGL is used to make this possible by virtue of its various functionalities.

We make use of simple geometric figures like rectangles and polygons to construct the parts of racing car and the track. Circles and parallelograms are used to generate the trees. Rectangles are used to generate obstacles.

The code implemented makes use of various OpenGL functions for translation and keyboard call back function, built-in functions for solids and many more.

The concepts of computer graphics stand a backbone to achieve the aforementioned idea. Primitive drawing, event driven interactions and basic animation have been the important concepts brought out by this application.


### Instructions to play the game:
To start the car first of all, press UP arrow from the keyboard.

Once the car starts moving just control the car movement using LEFT and RIGHT keyboard keys.

In case you hit with an obstacle the game gets over and to start the game again press the UP key twice or thrice.

### Output:
